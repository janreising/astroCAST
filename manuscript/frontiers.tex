    \section*{Author Contributions}
    JPR and EH conceptualized the study and EH secured funding for the project. JPR designed the algorithms, conducted the data analysis, and contributed to the building of the astroCAST toolkit. ACGS collaborated with JPR in building the toolkit. JPR wrote the manuscript, with contributions from ACGS and AS. EH and AS provided supervision throughout the project. All authors reviewed and approved the final manuscript.

    \section*{Use of Generative AI}
    During the preparation of this manuscript, we utilized the generative capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4. The AI's primary role was to assist in proofreading and language refinement to ensure clarity, conciseness, and readability of the text. While the AI provided suggestions for language adjustments, the final manuscript content was thoroughly reviewed, curated, and approved by the authors. We, the authors, take full and complete responsibility for the integrity and accuracy of the manuscript content.

    \section*{Funding}
    This study was supported by grants to EH from the Swedish Research Council (2019–01157), the Stockholm County Council (2019–0400, 2019–0974 and FoUI-966 449), the Swedish Brain (FO2019-0087 and FO2021-0313), the Swedish National Heart and Lung (2018 0505 and 2021 0579), the Axel Tielmans, the Freemasons Children's House foundations and Karolinska Institutet.
