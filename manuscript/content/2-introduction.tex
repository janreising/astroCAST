Astrocytes exhibit calcium fluctuations that are spatially and temporally diverse, reflecting their integration of a wide range of physiological signals\citep{semyanov_making_2020,smedler_frequency_2014}. Here, we provide a detailed guide for extracting these astrocytic calcium events from video recordings, performing clustering analysis, and correlating astrocyte activity with other physiological signals\fref{1}. This analysis has been applied to astrocytes in various settings, including acute slices, cell cultures, and in vivo recordings. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of astroCAST, using a custom dataset from a postnatal transgenic mouse brainstem, focusing on the \ac{preBÃ¶tC}, as well as utilizing publicly available data.
