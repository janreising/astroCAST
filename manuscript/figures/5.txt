Depiction of astrocytic event detection employed by astroCAST using spatial and temporal thresholding. A) Binary mask of frame after application of spatial threshold (min\_ratio 1). B) Binary mask of framer after application of temporal threshold (prominence 2, width 3, rel\_height 0.9). C) Frame used for thresholding after motion correction, denoising and smoothing. D) Events detected as identified by both spatial and temporal thresholding. E-G) Pixel intensity analysis for selected pixels (as indicated in Panels A-D), with active frames color-coded in the plots.
