Overview of Event Detection in Calcium Fluorescence Imaging. A) Calcium Fluorescence Processing: Post-motion correction and denoising, showcasing calcium fluorescence. Red dots signify the selected pixels for detailed analysis in Panel E. B) Event Identification: Events detected through both temporal and spatial thresholding techniques. Colored regions highlight the active events within specific pixels, illustrating the spatial distribution of neuronal activity. C) Temporal Thresholding: A binary mask generated by applying a temporal threshold, delineating periods of significant activity versus inactivity. D) Spatial Thresholding: A binary mask created by spatial thresholding to identify active regions, emphasizing the spatial aspects of neuronal activity. E) Pixel Intensity Analysis: Examination of pixel intensities for pixels indicated in Panel A. Colored regions within the plot correspond to frames identified as active, providing a temporal resolution of neuronal activity.
