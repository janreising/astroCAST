Performance of Different Algorithms on Analyzing Various Synthetic Datasets. A) Showcase of synthetic calcium events designed to represent various levels of analytical difficulty, where color coding corresponds to events generated under different parameter sets that simulate diverse conditions or event types. All events include a random noise amplitude of 0.001 and parameter fluctuations of 0.01, subtly varying each event's parameters. B) Conditional contrasts analysis assesses algorithmic efficiency in distinguishing events from differing conditions (groups 0, 1 and 2). Events are characterized using different methods: FExt for Feature Extraction, CNN for Convolutional Autoencoder, and RNN for Recurrent Autoencoder. The hierarchical clustering leverages distance metrics between events (Pearson correlation or dynamic time warping), depicted by the absence of training dependency in grey. CNN's inability to process variable-length events results in its omission in the final panel. C) Coincidence detection analysis gauges algorithm performance in predicting the occurrence of stimulus events. This encompasses two groups: one with events exclusively occurring during a stimulus and another with randomly occurring events. The embedding classifier and prediction methods are consistent with panel B, where the classifier identifies stimulus occurrence, and regression determines the exact timing of the stimulus in coinciding events. \added[id=R2]{Displayed scores represent the lowest achieved in three replicates, adhering to cross-validation principles}.
