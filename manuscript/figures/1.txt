AstroCAST Pipeline Overview: First box shows how the input video is converted and processed to detect events. Second box shows how the detected events undergo feature extraction utilizing different approaches to generate feature vectors. Last steps shows how feature vectors can be analyzed to identify patterns and correlations. Optional steps in the pipeline are indicated by dotted boxes, and outputs at each stage are shown in blue. Exemplary types of experiments explained in this protocol are highlighted in red.
