Schematic representation of the astroCaST toolkit comprising three major analytical phases for processing and analyzing astrocytic activity data. 1) In the preprocessing phase, video input is converted into an HDF5 file format, with optional stages for motion artifact correction, noise reduction, and background subtraction. 2) The event extraction phase involves the identification of astrocytic events, generating corresponding event traces and metadata. Events can subsequently undergo optional filtering, frame extension, and signal normalization. 3) The analysis of experiments is two-fold. For classification and regression, users may select from various feature vector embeddings including Feature Extraction (FExt), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). For hierarchical clustering, the toolkit offers Pearson correlation and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for the computation of event similarity, represented as a distance matrix. Dashed outlines denote optional steps within the process. The presence of an open eye icon signifies supervised steps, while a closed eye indicates unsupervised steps. A line terminating in a circle denotes need for additional user input.
