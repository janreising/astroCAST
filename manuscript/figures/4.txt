Comparison before and after the application of background subtraction to fluorescence imaging data. (A, C) fluorescence images before and after background subtraction, respectively, illustrating the removal of extraneous noise. After subtraction, the background is close to zero and exhibits overall lower noise levels. (B, D) Intensity traces corresponding to the marked points on the images are plotted over time (400 frames, 50s). These traces highlight the efficacy of background subtraction, with the post-subtraction traces approaching zero on the y-axis, thereby indicating a substantial reduction of background, while signal amplitude is conserved. However, the signal shapes, especially in the red trace, exhibit slight alterations post-subtraction. Moreover, the green trace reveals the inadvertent introduction of spurious events, serving as a cautionary example of how background subtraction can inadvertently affect data integrity if parameters are not judiciously optimized.
