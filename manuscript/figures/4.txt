Background Subtraction in Fluorescence Imaging Analysis. Comparative analysis of fluorescence images and pixel intensity traces before (top left) and after background subtraction (bottom left). Pixel intensity over time (right panels). These plots reveal the background noise reduction, where post-subtraction y-axis values are near zero, indicating effective subtraction. Event shapes remain consistent, verifying reliable preservation of events. Notably, the second panel (green) slightly alters the signal strength of events, underscoring the importance of careful parameter optimization or exclusion of this step if it compromises data fidelity.
