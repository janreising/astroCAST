 The Astrocast Viewer interface, showcasing a video file of astrocytic calcium fluorescence captured within the inspiratory rhythm generator (preBÃ¶tC) in the medulla. The original recording, acquired at a 20X magnification with a resolution of 1200x1200 pixels, was performed at a temporal resolution of 8Hz. The TIFF-format video was subsequently converted to the HDF5 file format, with spatial downscaling by a factor of four in the XY plane, as a preparatory step for further preprocessing.
