Comparative Visualization of Denoising on Video Frames and Pixel Intensity Measurements. Single frame (512x512 pixels) before denoising (left panel), showing notable background, and the corresponding frame after the application of a denoising algorithm, showing reduced background and enhanced clarity (middle panel). Pixel intensity traces from four selected points (right panel, P0-P3) in the video frame before denoising, displaying the variation over 200 frames. Right Plot) Pixel intensity traces for the same points after denoising, indicating a more stable intensity profile, while retaining features of the signal. The denoising algorithm was applied to a (128, 128) field of view with a configuration of 5 frames, each bordering the target frame, and no gap frames. The denoiser, trained for 50 epochs on a custom dataset, had a learning rate of 0.0001, momentum of 0.9, 3 layer stacks (n\_stacks), and 64 kernels of size 3 in the first layer without batch normalization. Inference involved a 10-pixel overlap in each direction with 'edge' padding. The test and validation were conducted using the same custom training dataset.
