\added[id=R1]{Performance Comparison of astroCaST and AQuA on Synthetic Calcium Imaging Datasets. A-B) Evaluation of computational efficiency for astroCaST and AQuA across synthetic video datasets of varying dimensions (100-5000 frames, 100x100 - 1200x1200 pixels). A) Graphical representation of runtime for each algorithm. B) Analysis of peak memory consumption during the event detection phase. A run was considered failed if it exceeded available memory (76.8 GB). C-D) Assessment of the accuracy in detecting astrocytic calcium events by astroCaST (C) and AQuA (D) without initial preprocessing steps. Detected events smaller than 5 and larger than 1000 frames were excluded for visualization purposes. The dotted line marks the ideal correlation between the synthetic events generated and those identified by the algorithm.}
