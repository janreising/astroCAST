Although not electrically excitable, astrocytes display a complex repertoire of intracellular Ca2+ signalling that evolves in space and time within single astrocytes and across astrocytic networks. Decoding the physiological meaning of these dynamic changes in astrocytic Ca2+ activity has remained a major challenge. This Review describes experimental preparations and methods for recording and studying Ca2+ activity in astrocytes, focusing on the analysis of Ca2+ signalling events in single astrocytes and in astrocytic networks. The limitations of existing experimental approaches and ongoing technical and conceptual challenges in the interpretation of astrocytic Ca2+ events and their spatio-temporal patterns are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Advances in fluorescence microscopy enable monitoring larger brain areas in-vivo with finer time resolution. The resulting data rates require reproducible analysis pipelines that are reliable, fully automated, and scalable to datasets generated over the course of months. We present CaImAn, an open-source library for calcium imaging data analysis. CaImAn provides automatic and scalable methods to address problems common to pre-processing, including motion correction, neural activity identification, and registration across different sessions of data collection. It does this while requiring minimal user intervention, with good scalability on computers ranging from laptops to high-performance computing clusters. CaImAn is suitable for two-photon and one-photon imaging, and also enables real-time analysis on streaming data. To benchmark the performance of CaImAn we collected and combined a corpus of manual annotations from multiple labelers on nine mouse two-photon datasets. We demonstrate that CaImAn achieves near-human performance in detecting locations of active neurons.
          , 
            The human brain contains billions of cells called neurons that rapidly carry information from one part of the brain to another. Progress in medical research and healthcare is hindered by the difficulty in understanding precisely which neurons are active at any given time. New brain imaging techniques and genetic tools allow researchers to track the activity of thousands of neurons in living animals over many months. However, these experiments produce large volumes of data that researchers currently have to analyze manually, which can take a long time and generate irreproducible results.
            There is a need to develop new computational tools to analyze such data. The new tools should be able to operate on standard computers rather than just specialist equipment as this would limit the use of the solutions to particularly well-funded research teams. Ideally, the tools should also be able to operate in real-time as several experimental and therapeutic scenarios, like the control of robotic limbs, require this. To address this need, Giovannucci et al. developed a new software package called CaImAn to analyze brain images on a large scale.
            Firstly, the team developed algorithms that are suitable to analyze large sets of data on laptops and other standard computing equipment. These algorithms were then adapted to operate online in real-time. To test how well the new software performs against manual analysis by human researchers, Giovannucci et al. asked several trained human annotators to identify active neurons that were round or donut-shaped in several sets of imaging data from mouse brains. Each set of data was independently analyzed by three or four researchers who then discussed any neurons they disagreed on to generate a ‘consensus annotation’. Giovannucci et al. then used CaImAn to analyze the same sets of data and compared the results to the consensus annotations. This demonstrated that CaImAn is nearly as good as human researchers at identifying active neurons in brain images.
            CaImAn provides a quicker method to analyze large sets of brain imaging data and is currently used by over a hundred laboratories across the world. The software is open source, meaning that it is freely-available and that users are encouraged to customize it and collaborate with other users to develop it further.},

	abstract = {Recent work examining astrocytic physiology centers on fluorescence imaging approaches, due to development of sensitive fluorescent indicators and observation of spatiotemporally complex calcium and glutamate activity. However, the field remains hindered in fully characterizing these dynamics, both within single cells and at the population-level, because of the insufficiency of current region-of-interest-based approaches to describe activity that is often spatially unfixed, size-varying, and propagative. Here, we present a paradigm-shifting analytical framework that releases astrocyte biologists from ROI-based tools. Astrocyte Quantitative Analysis (AQuA) software enables users to take an event-based approach to accurately capture and quantify the irregular activity observed in astrocyte imaging datasets. We apply AQuA to a range of ex vivo  and in vivo imaging data, and uncover previously undescribed physiological phenomena in each. Since AQuA is data-driven and based on machine learning principles, it can be applied across model organisms, fluorescent indicators, experimental modes, and imaging resolutions and speeds, enabling researchers to elucidate fundamental astrocyte physiology.},

Human studies have consistently observed glial dysfunction in mood and stress disorders such as major depression. Interestingly animal models of stress have recapitulated glial abnormalities that are comparable to the human condition, validating the use of rodent models for the study of stress disorders.

	abstract = {Ca2+ is a major second messenger involved in cellular and subcellular signaling in a wide range of cells, including astrocytes, which use calcium ions to communicate with other cells in the brain. Even though a variety of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators have been developed to study astrocyte calcium signaling, understanding the dynamics of endoplasmic reticulum calcium signaling is greatly limited by the currently available tools. To address this, we developed an endoplasmic reticulum-targeted calcium indicator, ER-GCaMP6f, which is anchored to the cytosolic side of the organelle and measures signaling that occurs in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum of astrocytes. Using a combination of confocal and super-resolution microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the localization of the indicator in the endoplasmic reticulum in both cell soma and processes of astrocytes. Combining ER-GCaMP6f with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that Ca2+ fluctuations in small astrocytic processes can be detected, which are otherwise not observable with existing indicators and standard wide-field and confocal techniques. We also compared the ER-GCaMP6f indicator against currently used plasma membrane-tethered and cytosolic GCaMP6f indicators. ER-GCaMP6f identifies dynamics in calcium signaling of endoplasmic reticulum resident receptors that are missed by plasma membrane-anchored indicators. We also generated an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) and demonstrate that ER-GCaMP6f can be expressed in vivo and by measured calcium activity in brain slices. ER-GCaMP6f provides a powerful tool to study calcium signaling in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum in astrocyte cell soma and processes both in culture and in brain slices.},

However, because previous reports show that astrocytic calcium signals largely mirror neighboring neuronal activity, current information coding models neglect astrocytes. Using simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual environment, we demonstrate that astrocytic calcium signals encode (i.e., statistically reflect) spatial information that could not be explained by visual cue information. Calcium events carrying spatial information occurred in topographically organized astrocytic subregions. Importantly, astrocytes encoded spatial information that was complementary and synergistic to that carried by neurons, improving spatial position decoding when astrocytic signals were considered alongside neuronal ones. These results suggest that the complementary place dependence of localized astrocytic calcium signals may regulate clusters of nearby synapses, enabling dynamic, context-dependent variations in population coding within brain circuits.},

	abstract = {Long-term modifications of astrocyte function and morphology are well known to occur in epilepsy. They are implicated in the development and manifestation of the disease, but the relevant mechanisms and their pathophysiological role are not firmly established. For instance, it is unclear how quickly the onset of epileptic activity triggers astrocyte morphology changes and what the relevant molecular signals are. We therefore used two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to monitor astrocyte morphology in parallel to the induction of epileptiform activity. We uncovered astrocyte morphology changes within 10–20 min under various experimental conditions in acute hippocampal slices. In vivo, induction of status epilepticus resulted in similarly altered astrocyte morphology within 30 min. Further analysis in vitro revealed a persistent volume reduction of peripheral astrocyte processes triggered by induction of epileptiform activity. In addition, an impaired diffusion within astrocytes and within the astrocyte network was observed, which most likely is a direct consequence of the astrocyte remodeling. These astrocyte morphology changes were prevented by inhibition of the Rho GTPase RhoA and of the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). Selective deletion of ROCK1 but not ROCK2 from astrocytes also prevented the morphology change after induction of epileptiform activity and reduced epileptiform activity. Together these observations reveal that epileptic activity triggers a rapid ROCK1-dependent astrocyte morphology change, which is mechanistically linked to the strength of epileptiform activity. This suggests that astrocytic ROCK1 signaling is a maladaptive response of astrocytes to the onset of epileptic activity.},

Here, we used novel combinations of genetically encoded calcium indicators for concurrent two-photon imaging of cortical astrocytes and neurons in awake mice during whisker deflection. We identified calcium responses in both astrocyte processes and endfeet that rapidly followed neuronal events (∼120 ms after). These fast astrocyte responses were largely independent of IP3R2-mediated signaling and known neuromodulator activity (acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine), suggesting that they are evoked by local synaptic activity. The existence of such rapid signals implies that astrocytes are fast enough to play a role in synaptic modulation and neurovascular coupling.

	abstract = {cAMP analogues such as dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) have been shown to induce the formation of processes in cultured primary astrocytes. We observe that the processes form by elongation as well as the previously reported retraction of cytoplasm around cytoskeletal elements. The most prominent cytoskeletal change that occurs in response to dBcAMP is a rearrangement of actin filaments characterized by a loss of cortical F-actin staining and the appearance of actin filament staining at the tips of the processes. If cortical actin filaments are disrupted with dihydrocytochalasin B, processes form that are similar to those induced by dBcAMP suggesting that the disruption of the cortical actin network is the pivotal step in process formation. Reorganization of the actin filament network in response to cAMP is accompanied by a decrease in phosphate incorporation into the regulatory light chain of myosin (MLC). Two selective inhibitors of MLC kinase (MLCK), ML-9 and KT5926, as well as a calmodulin antagonist (W7), which would also inhibit MLCK activation, all induce astrocytic process growth implicating MLCK as a control point in process initiation. We also found that dBcAMP and ML-9 both cause a decrease in the phosphate content of actin depolymerizing factor, suggesting that this protein and myosin light chain are the effectors of actin cytoskeleton reorganization and process growth.},

	abstract = {Astrocytes intimately interact with synapses, both morphologically and, as evidenced in the past 20 years, at the functional level. Ultrathin astrocytic processes contact and sometimes enwrap the synaptic elements, sense synaptic transmission and shape or alter the synaptic signal by releasing signalling molecules. Yet, the consequences of such interactions in terms of information processing in the brain remain very elusive. This is largely due to two major constraints: (i) the exquisitely complex, dynamic and ultrathin nature of distal astrocytic processes that renders their investigation highly challenging and (ii) our lack of understanding of how information is encoded by local and global fluctuations of intracellular calcium concentrations in astrocytes. Here, we will review the existing anatomical and functional evidence of local interactions between astrocytes and synapses, and how it underlies a role for astrocytes in the computation of synaptic information.

	abstract = {Astrocytes, a glial cell type of the central nervous system, have emerged as detectors and regulators of neuronal information processing. Astrocyte excitability resides in transient variations of free cytosolic calcium concentration over a range of temporal and spatial scales, from sub-microdomains to waves propagating throughout the cell. Despite extensive experimental approaches, it is not clear how these signals are transmitted to and integrated within an astrocyte. The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels IP3R, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an IP3R-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes. To account for the expected stochasticity and low copy numbers, our model is both spatially explicit and particle-based. Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity. The model reproduces the main forms of calcium signals and indicates that their frequency crucially depends on the spatial organization of the IP3R channels. Importantly, we show that two processes expressing exactly the same calcium channels can display different types of calcium signals depending on the spatial organization of the channels. Our model with realistic process volume and calcium concentrations successfully reproduces spontaneous calcium signals that we measured in calcium micro-domains with confocal microscopy and predicts that local variations of calcium indicators might contribute to the diversity of calcium signals observed in astrocytes. To our knowledge, this model is the first model suited to investigate calcium dynamics in fine astrocytic processes and to propose plausible mechanisms responsible for their variability.},

In addition to homeostatic roles, astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters with calcium transients stimulating the release of gliotransmitters that regulate synaptic and neuronal functions. We investigated astrocyte-neuronal network interactions in vivo by combining two-photon microscopy to monitor astrocyte calcium and electrocorticogram to record neuronal network activity in the somatosensory cortex during sensory stimulation. We found astrocytes respond to sensory stimuli in a stimulus-dependent manner. Sensory stimuli elicit a surge of neuronal network activity in the gamma range (30–50 Hz) followed by a delayed astrocyte activity that dampens the steady-state gamma activity. This sensory-evoked gamma activity increase is enhanced in transgenic mice with impaired astrocyte calcium signaling and is decreased by pharmacogenetic stimulation of astrocytes. Therefore, cortical astrocytes respond to sensory inputs and regulate sensory-evoked neuronal network activity maximizing its dynamic range.},

METHODS Here we review use of YC3.6 in studying Alzheimer's disease using mouse models and discuss whether these studies support or refute the Calcium Hypothesis. RESULTS YC3.6 studies showed that amyloidosis preceded dysfunction in neuronal calcium signaling and changes in synapse structure. This evidence supports the Calcium Hypothesis.

	abstract = {The characteristics of a cellular calcium signal (calcium signature) are determined, at least partly, by the expression of a subset of genes encoding proteins involved in calcium entry, calcium uptake and calcium modulation. Our aim in the present work was to characterize the set of genes involved in calcium signal generation that are differentially expressed in normal brain tissues versus brain tumor and/or glioma stem cells. Public datasets were analyzed according to a four step methodology consisting of: 1. detecting the outliers by using principal component analysis of the whole transcriptome; 2. building a calcium toolbox composed of 260 genes involved in the generation and modulation of the calcium signal; 3. analyzing the calcium toolbox transcriptome of different human brain areas and 4. detecting genes from the calcium toolbox preferentially expressed in tumor tissues or tumor cells compared to normal brain tissues. Our approach was validated on normal brain tissue. Tumor sample analysis allowed us to disclose a set of eighteen genes characteristic of glioblastoma tissues or glioma stem cells. Interpreting the set of genes highlighted in the study led us to propose that i) the mechanism of store operated calcium entry is strongly perturbed in cancer cells and tissues, ii) the process of calcium reuptake into mitochondria is more important in cancer cells and tissues than in their normal counterparts and iii) these two mechanisms may be coupled in at least one subgroup of the glioblastoma stem cells.},

	abstract = {Spatial and temporal abnormalities in the frequency and amplitude of the cytosolic calcium oscillations can impact the normal physiological functions of neuronal cells. Recent studies have shown that ketamine can affect the growth and development and even induce the apoptotic death of neurons. This study used isolated developing hippocampal neurons as its study subjects to observe the effect of ketamine on the intracellular calcium oscillations in developing hippocampal neurons and to further explore its underlying mechanism using Fluo-4-loaded laser scanning confocal microscopy. Using a semi-quantitative method to analyze the spontaneous calcium oscillatory activities, a typical type of calcium oscillation was observed in developing hippocampal neurons. In addition, the administration of NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) at a concentration of 100 µM increased the calcium oscillation amplitude. The administration of MK801 at a concentration of 40 µM inhibited the amplitude and frequency of the calcium oscillations. Our results demonstrated that an increase in the ketamine concentration, starting from 30 µM, gradually decreased the neuronal calcium oscillation amplitude. The inhibition of the calcium oscillation frequency by 300 µM ketamine was statistically significant, and the neuronal calcium oscillations were completely eliminated with the administration of 3,000 µM Ketamine. The administration of 100, 300, and 1,000 µM NMDA to the 1 mM ketamine-pretreated hippocampal neurons restored the frequency and amplitude of the calcium oscillations in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, a concentration of 1,000 µM NMDA completely reversed the decrease in the calcium oscillation frequency and amplitude that was induced by 1 mM ketamine. This study revealed that ketamine can inhibit the frequency and amplitude of the calcium oscillations in developing hippocampal neurons though the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) in a dose-dependent manner, which might highlight a possible underlying mechanism of ketamine toxicity on the rat hippocampal neurons during development.},

	abstract = {Aggregation or phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is the pathological hallmark in a number of diseases termed tauopathies, which include the most common neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s disease; or frontotemporal dementia, linked to mutations in the gene MAPT encoding tau. Although misfolded tau has strong familial and histopathological (as in intracellular tangles) association with neurodegenerative disorders, the cellular mechanism of tau-induced pathology remains to be controversial. Here we studied the effect of tau on the cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis using primary cortical cultures treated with the protein and iPSC-derived neurons bearing the 10 + 16 MAPT mutation linked to frontotemporal dementia. We found that incubation of the primary cortical co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes with tau induced spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in the neurons, which were also observed in iPSC-neurons with the 10 + 16 MAPT mutation. Importantly, tau inhibited mitochondrial calcium efflux via the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX) in both neurons and astrocytes. This inhibition led to mitochondrial depolarisation in response to physiological and pathological calcium stimuli and made these cells vulnerable to calcium-induced caspase 3 activation and cell death. Thus, inhibition of the mitochondrial NCLX in neurons with misfolded or mutated tau can be involved in the mechanism of neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Estrogens are used extensively to treat hot flashes in menopausal women. Some of the beneficial effects of estrogens in hormone therapy on the brain might be due to nongenomic effects in neurons such as the rapid stimulation of calcium oscillations. Most studies have examined the nongenomic effects of estrogen receptors (ER) in primary neurons or brain slices from the rodent brain. However, these cells can not be maintained continuously in culture because neurons are post-mitotic. Neurons derived from embryonic stem cells could be a potential continuous, cell-based model to study nongenomic actions of estrogens in neurons if they are responsive to estrogens after differentiation. In this study ER-subtype specific estrogens were used to examine the role of ERα and ERβ on calcium oscillations in neurons derived from human (hES) and mouse embryonic stem cells. Unlike the undifferentiated hES cells the differentiated cells expressed neuronal markers, ERβ, but not ERα. The non-selective ER agonist 17β-estradiol (E2) rapidly increased [Ca2+]i oscillations and synchronizations within a few minutes. No change in calcium oscillations was observed with the selective ERα agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-Propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT). In contrast, the selective ERβ agonists, 2,3-bis(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN), MF101, and 2-(3-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-7-vinyl-1,3 benzoxazol-5-ol (ERB-041; WAY-202041) stimulated calcium oscillations similar to E2. The ERβ agonists also increased calcium oscillations and phosphorylated PKC, AKT and ERK1/2 in neurons derived from mouse ES cells, which was inhibited by nifedipine demonstrating that ERβ activates L-type voltage gated calcium channels to regulate neuronal activity. Our results demonstrate that ERβ signaling regulates nongenomic pathways in neurons derived from ES cells, and suggest that these cells might be useful to study the nongenomic mechanisms of estrogenic compounds.},

Imaging calcium in neurons is particularly important because calcium signals exert their highly specific functions in well-defined cellular subcompartments. In this Primer, we briefly review the general mechanisms of neuronal calcium signaling. We then introduce the calcium imaging devices, including confocal and two-photon microscopy as well as miniaturized devices that are used in freely moving animals. We provide an overview of the classical chemical fluorescent calcium indicators and of the protein-based genetically encoded calcium indicators. Using application examples, we introduce new developments in the field, such as calcium imaging in awake, behaving animals and the use of calcium imaging for mapping single spine sensory inputs in cortical neurons in vivo. We conclude by providing an outlook on the prospects of calcium imaging for the analysis of neuronal signaling and plasticity in various animal models.},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to ∼2-5 μm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5\%.},
