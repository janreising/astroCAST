   \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

    \item \textbf{Astrocyte-Specific Challenges (R2):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enhance the discussion on page 2, lines 31-37, detailing how astroCAST addresses astrocytic-specific challenges such as rapid calcium fluctuations and morphological changes.
        \item Include references to previous studies that highlight these issues and demonstrate astroCAST's tailored approach.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Comparison with AQuA (R1, R2):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose 1 dataset from AQuA, 1 from Glue or Glitch, and a separate one.
        \item Analyze with each and compare result for event detection. Specifically, speed, accuracy, memory usage, usefulness of results.
        \item Plot results or create a table.
        \item Add a section in the results or discussion.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Complexity of Calcium Transients in Figure 6 (R1, R2):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \sout{Add multiple peak panel (R1).}
        \item Minimum number of examples needed to ensure proper embedding (R2).
    \end{itemize}
       \item Check legends for astroCaST vs astroCAST
\end{itemize}
