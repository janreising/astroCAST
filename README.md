# astroCAST

astroCAST is a Python package designed for analyzing calcium fluorescence events in astrocytes. It provides various functionalities to process and explore calcium imaging data, identify events, and perform spatiotemporal analysis.

## Features

- Fast data preparation
- Efficient event detection algorithm
- Visualization tools for exploring calcium imaging data and events
- Calculation of spatial statistics and cluster analysis
- Modularity detection and analysis of astrocyte modules

## Summary
Astrocytic calcium event analysis is challenging due to its complex nature, spatiotemporally overlapping events, and variable lengths. Our Astrocytic Calcium Signaling Toolkit (astroCAST) addresses these challenges by efficiently implementing event detection and variable length clustering. Leveraging dynamic thresholding, astroCAST captures diverse calcium fluctuations effectively. Designed for modularity, parallelization, and memory-efficiency, it enables fast and scalable event detection on large datasets.

## Installation<a name="installation">
You can install astroCAST using pip: 
```shell 
pip install astrocast[all]
```

Alternatively, clone this repository and install it locally:
```shell
pip install poetry
poetry install --with vis
```
## Containers<a name="containers">
Now astroCAST implementation can run from inside docker and singularity.
Currently, we support astroCAST in MacOS through docker, but other operating systems supporting docker may as well run astroCAST docker container. For more infomation on how to install docker and create an account, please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/. For more information on how to install singularity and create an account visit https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html.

### Docker container<a name="docker-container">
Once docker has been installed, run the following commands in the terminal:
```shell
docker pull anacgon/astrocast:1.1
```
This may take some minutes as the image is pulled from docker hub. Once the image has been pulled locally, make sure it was correctly fetched by running:
```shell
docker image ls
```
You should be able to see the docker image listed.

To run the image use:
```shell
docker run -v /path/to/your/data:/home/data -it -p 8888:8888 astrocast:1.1 
```
Note: "/path/to/your/data" must be replaced with your local path to the data you will use for the analysis. -p option allows the container to expose port 8888, necessary to run jupyterlab inside the container.

To start a new jupyterlab session from inside the container, run:
```shell
jupyter-lab --allow-root --no-browser --port=8888 --ip="*"
```
Note: the explorer window will not be open automatically, instead you must copy and paste the URL provided in the console.

For more detailed examples and usage instructions, please refer to to the companion paper [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4491483) (currently in preprint).

### Singularity container<a name="singularity">
Singularity (apptainer) now supports direct conversion of docker images into singularity. To pull and run the image use the following commands:
NOTE: singularity must be installed.

Pull singularity image directly from dockerhub.
```shell
singularity pull docker://anacgon/astrocast:1.1
```

Once image has been pulled, an SIF file will be created in the directory where the previous command was run. To run the singularity image then run:

```shell
singularity run --writable-tmpfs astrocast_1.1.sif
```
Note1: Singularity automatically mounts host file system, so manual mounting is not required.
Note2: For the moment, we don't support running jupyer-labs inside singularity containers.
